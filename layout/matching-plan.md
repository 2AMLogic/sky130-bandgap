# Bandgap core -- floorplan and matching plan (issues #15, #62)

Written matching plan + initial placed layout skeleton for the sky130
Kuijk-style bandgap core (`design/bandgap_core.sch`, `design/error_amp.sch`).
This document states the matching-effort allocation and the reasoning
behind it; `layout/bin/gen_bandgap_floorplan.py` /
`layout/bin/run-bandgap-floorplan-flow.sh` generate, place, and DRC-check
the skeleton this document describes -- see
[`layout/bandgap-core/reports/LATEST`](bandgap-core/reports/LATEST) for the
current evidence record (DRC-clean, area-budget-clean; read that record's
`record.md` first for the actual pass/fail evidence, this document is the
rationale, not the proof).

Scope, per issue #15's acceptance criteria: a floorplan + this written
matching plan, plus an *initial* placed layout skeleton that passes DRC.
This is not a tape-out-ready layout -- routing, exact spacing
optimization, and full LVS closure on the matched-device generators are
explicitly out of scope here and flagged as follow-on work in "Known
limitations" below.

## 1. Matching-effort allocation, driven by issue #12's contributor breakdown

Issue #12's Monte Carlo mismatch analysis
(`sim/monte-carlo-untrimmed/records/20260803-142259-544cc5e.md`) isolated
three independent local-mismatch contributors to the untrimmed output
spread by re-running the same testbench with each of the other two
families' PDK mismatch coefficients zeroed. Its own "Contributor breakdown"
table:

| T (degC) | PNP array 1 sigma (mV) | resistor network 1 sigma (mV) | amp/mirror MOS 1 sigma (mV) | measured sigma(all) (mV) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| -40 | 1.157 | 1.644 | 4.465 | 4.879 |
| 27 | 1.410 | 2.152 | 4.434 | 4.988 |
| 125 | 1.958 | 2.768 | 4.197 | 5.205 |

**The amp/mirror MOS term dominates at every temperature** -- roughly
4.2-4.5 mV of a 4.9-5.2 mV total 1 sigma, i.e. its variance alone (the RSS
decomposition closes to within 0.965-0.996 of the measured total, per that
record's own closure check) accounts for the large majority of the
untrimmed spread. The PNP array and resistor network terms are both
smaller and comparable in magnitude to each other, with the resistor term
growing fastest with temperature (2.77 mV at 125 degC vs. 1.96 mV for the
PNP array).

Issue #9's error-amplifier offset budget
(`design/error-amp-offset-budget.md` Sections 1-4) decomposes that
dominant amp/mirror term one level further, by device group, at 27 degC
(N = 300 Monte Carlo, `sim/error-amp-offset-mc/`):

| Group | W x L x mult | area | contribution to sigma(VOS) |
|---|---|---|---|
| MP1/MP2 input pair | 20 x 10 x 16 | 3200 um^2 each | 0.300 mV |
| MN1-MN4 loads/mirrors | 8 x 20 x 4 | 640 um^2 each | 0.301 mV |
| MP3/MP4 PMOS mirror | 6 x 20 x 8 | 960 um^2 each | 0.190 mV |

Two findings drive this plan's priority order directly:

1. **The amp's input pair and its NMOS load/mirror quad contribute
   essentially equally** (0.300 vs 0.301 mV) -- neither can be treated as
   the "real" matching-critical group with the other as secondary. Both are
   top priority. The PMOS mirror (MP3/MP4) contributes meaningfully but
   less (0.190 mV) -- still matched, but not over-built at the other two
   groups' expense.
2. Through the core's measured 9.65 offset gain
   (`design/error-amp-offset-budget.md` Section 1), this amplifier random
   offset is **74-90% of the untrimmed output variance** at every
   temperature (Section 6) -- i.e. it is not just the largest of three
   comparable terms, it is close to the whole story.

**Allocation, in priority order:**

| Priority | Matched group | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | Amp input pair (MP1/MP2) | Dominant single contributor (#12), tied with the NMOS quad for largest single-group share of sigma(VOS) (#9) |
| 1 (tied) | Amp NMOS load/mirror quad (MN1-MN4) | Same as above -- #9 measured these two groups contribute equally; layout effort must not favor one over the other |
| 2 | Amp PMOS mirror (MP3/MP4) | Smaller but non-negligible share of sigma(VOS) (0.190 mV of 0.525 mV measured); still common-centroid, not an afterthought |
| 3 | Resistor network (R1/R2A/R2B + trim) | Second-largest of the three #12-isolated families; grows fastest with temperature, so the 125 degC corner is where under-matching it would show up first |
| 4 | PNP array (Q1/Q2) | Smallest of the three #12-isolated families at every temperature, but not zero, and this is the group whose own 8x arraying (already reflected in the skeleton's device counts) is what took its own local mismatch down from a much worse un-arrayed figure (`design/device-characterization-summary.md` Section 4) -- still requires common-centroid + dummy ring, per acceptance criteria and because it still consumes 0.29-0.49% of a 1.2 V output at 1 sigma on its own |

This is the reasoning `layout/bin/gen_bandgap_floorplan.py`'s block list and
placement follow: every matched group gets a common-centroid/cross-quad
layout with dummies, but the amp's three groups (and within that, the
input pair and NMOS quad specifically) are where a layout reviewer's
scrutiny should concentrate first if area or time forces a tradeoff later.

## 2. Device inventory

From `design/bandgap_core.sch` and `design/error_amp.sch` (read-only
references for this issue; not modified here):

| Device | Role | Geometry | Matched against |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | CTAT PNP | m=8 x `pnp_05v5_W0p68L0p68` (0.4624 um^2/unit) | itself (8x array) |
| Q2 | PTAT PNP | m=8 x `pnp_05v5_W3p40L3p40` (11.56 um^2/unit) | itself (8x array) |
| R1 | dVBE-to-current leg | `res_high_po`, W=1um, L=35um (7 x 5um unit segments) | R2A/R2B via the K=R2/R1 ratio |
| R2A | VOUT-side divider leg (branch A) | `res_high_po`, W=1um, L=270um + trim (54 x 5um unit segments) | R2B |
| R2B | VOUT-side divider leg (branch B) | `res_high_po`, W=1um, L=270um + trim (54 x 5um unit segments) | R2A |
| trim taps | downward-only ladder-tap trim (DR-002) | `res_high_po`, W=1um, 1um/code, code 0..-16, both legs | integrated into the R2A/R2B array (this issue's acceptance criterion) |
| MPOUT | core PMOS output mirror | mult=2 x W=8/L=2 `pfet_g5v0d10v5` | MPAMP |
| MPAMP | core PMOS bias mirror | mult=2 x W=8/L=2 `pfet_g5v0d10v5` | MPOUT |
| MP1/MP2 | amp PMOS input pair | mult=16 x W=20/L=10 `pfet_g5v0d10v5` | each other |
| MN1/MN2 | amp NMOS diode loads | mult=4 x W=8/L=20 `nfet_g5v0d10v5` | each other, and MN3/MN4 (one 4-device group per #9) |
| MN3/MN4 | amp NMOS mirror outputs | mult=4 x W=8/L=20 `nfet_g5v0d10v5` | each other, and MN1/MN2 |
| MP3/MP4 | amp PMOS mirror | mult=8 x W=6/L=20 `pfet_g5v0d10v5` | each other |
| MCC | amp compensation cap (PMOS-as-cap) | mult=16 x W=30/L=20 `pfet_g5v0d10v5` | single-ended -- not a matched pair |

## 3. Floorplan

Four bands, stacked and horizontally centered (see
`layout/bin/gen_bandgap_floorplan.py`'s `place_blocks()` for the exact,
bbox-derived placement math -- nothing below is a hardcoded pixel
coordinate):

```
 +------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |                  outer guard ring (VSS tap, whole cell)          |
 |  +--------------------------------------------------------------+|
 |  |  MN3/MN4        MP3/MP4              MPOUT/MPAMP              ||  row 3
 |  |  (own ring)     (own ring)            (own ring)              ||
 |  |----------------------------------------------------------------||
 |  |  MP1/MP2 input pair (own ring)     MN1/MN2 (own ring)          ||  row 2
 |  |----------------------------------------------------------------||
 |  |  R2A/R2B interdigitated  R1        trim taps                   ||  row 1
 |  |----------------------------------------------------------------||
 |  |  Q1 (own collector ring)   Q2 (own collector ring)              ||  row 0
 |  +--------------------------------------------------------------+|
 +------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Row order (bottom to top, increasing y in the generated skeleton):

- **Row 0 -- PNP array.** Q1 (CTAT, small unit, 2x4 common-centroid, 1
  dummy column/side) and Q2 (PTAT, large unit, same arrangement)
  side by side, each with its own collector/substrate guard ring
  (`bjt_array`'s `add_collector_ring`). They are not interleaved with each
  other at the unit-device level -- the PDK offers only two fixed PNP
  geometries, so Q1's and Q2's units cannot physically share a common
  centroid cell the way two same-size devices can. Placing the two arrays
  immediately adjacent, each internally common-centroid and dummy-ringed,
  is the practical equivalent: it minimizes the physical separation (and
  therefore the die-gradient exposure difference) between "the CTAT leg's
  average location" and "the PTAT leg's average location," which is what
  actually matters for the VA/VB comparison the amplifier makes.
- **Row 1 -- resistor network.** R2A/R2B as one interdigitated ladder
  (alternating unit segments -- see "Skeleton vs. real target counts"
  below for why the skeleton draws 16 of the real 108), R1 as its own
  matched group (same flavor/orientation, not interdigitated with R2A/R2B
  since it is a different nominal value with no same-value partner), and
  the downward-only trim taps as a third array of the same flavor/
  orientation, positioned to extend the R2A/R2B ladder (this issue's
  acceptance criterion: trim segments integrated into the same array, not
  a separate bolt-on structure).
- **Row 2 -- amp input pair + NMOS loads.** MP1/MP2 (cross-quad
  common-centroid PMOS input pair, in an n-well, own guard ring) and
  MN1/MN2 (cross-quad common-centroid NMOS diode loads, own guard ring),
  adjacent so the two top-priority-tied groups from Section 1 sit in the
  same band, closest to each other of any two matched groups in this
  floorplan.
- **Row 3 -- amp mirrors + core mirror.** MN3/MN4 (NMOS mirror outputs,
  own guard ring), MP3/MP4 (PMOS mirror, own guard ring, in an n-well),
  and MPOUT/MPAMP (the core's own PMOS output/bias mirror, own guard ring,
  in an n-well).

One overall guard ring (`guard_ring` generator, tap ring + well tie)
encloses all four rows, sized and centered from the composed content's own
reported bounding box (`gen_bandgap_floorplan.py`'s `RING_MARGIN_UM`
clearance on every side) -- not a fixed placeholder size, so it stays
correct if any block's size changes.

See
[`layout/bandgap-core/reports/LATEST/renders/overview.png`](bandgap-core/reports/LATEST/renders/overview.png)
(resolve `LATEST` to the current record id) for a rendered top-down view:
every matched group's own inner ring and interdigitated/cross-quad
striping is visible at that scale, which is this issue's test-plan item
for visually verifying common-centroid symmetry and dummy-ring coverage.

## 4. Skeleton vs. real target counts

Every block draws the real schematic W/L/mult/rows/cols/splits **except**
the R2A/R2B interdigitated ladder, which the skeleton draws at reduced
scale:

| Block | Skeleton count | Real target | Why reduced |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pnp_ctat` / `pnp_ptat` | 8 units each (2x4) | 8 units each | drawn 1:1 |
| `res_r2` (R2A/R2B) | 16 units (8/leg) -- **superseded, see below** | 108 units (54/leg) | *(historical, #15)* a single-row `res_array` at 108 units is ~710 um long (measured directly: `klt gen res_array --params '{"num":108,...}'` reports `bbox_um.x1 - x0 = 709.6`) -- pairing that with any other block in a floorplan forces the whole composition's bounding box past the 0.05 mm^2 budget on width alone, even though the segments' own drawn area is small. `klt gen res_array` had no row-folding/meander parameter to keep a long unit-resistor string's *footprint* compact the way `mos_array`/`bjt_array`'s `rows`/`cols` do -- filed as new friction, [2AMLogic/klayout-tools#415](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/415). |
| `res_r1` | 7 units | 7 units | drawn 1:1 (small enough to be tractable at full scale) |
| `res_trim` | 32 units (16/leg) | 32 units (16/leg) | drawn 1:1 |
| `amp_input_pair` | mult=16 (splits=16) | mult=16 | drawn 1:1 |
| `amp_nload` / `amp_nmirr` | mult=4 each | mult=4 each | drawn 1:1 |
| `amp_pmirr` | mult=8 (splits=8) | mult=8 | drawn 1:1 |
| `core_mirror` | mult=2 (splits=2) | mult=2 | drawn 1:1 |

### 4a. Ladder scale reduction: closed (issue #62)

**2AMLogic/klayout-tools#415 landed** (merged upstream via
klayout-tools#418), adding `res_array`'s `rows` fold parameter. The routed
flow (`layout/bin/gen_bandgap_routed.py`) therefore draws the R2A/R2B ladder
at its **real 108-unit count**, folded into 9 rows:

| | skeleton (#15) | routed (#62) |
|---|---|---|
| `res_r2` unit count | 16 | **108** (2 legs x n_r2=54) |
| `res_r2` footprint | ~110 x 12 um | ~101 x 12 um (9 folded rows) |
| composed cell bbox | 35,763 um^2 | **38,171 um^2** |
| budget | 50,000 um^2 | 50,000 um^2 |

Folding turns the ladder from the floorplan's width-dominating block into
one of its smaller ones: 108 units cost ~1,231 um^2 of footprint, and the
whole routed cell -- at the real count, with routing and the cell-level
guard ring -- still lands ~24% inside the 0.05 mm^2 budget. `res_r1`
(n_r1=7) and the trim ladder (32 taps) were already 1:1 and stay so; the
trim ladder is now folded into 4 rows for the same footprint reason.

The area-budget claim in Section 6 was previously caveated as "does not yet
include the R2A/R2B ladder at its real count". That caveat is now closed.

## 5. Supply/ground and guard-ring strategy

Consistent with the measured PSRR (77.7 dB at DC, worst case sf/125 degC/
2.97 V, `sim/error-amp-loop/` record `20260803-085320-e599e30`, per
`design/error-amp-offset-budget.md` Section 5):

- **Every matched group gets its own local guard/collector ring**
  (`bjt_array`'s `add_collector_ring`, `diff_pair`'s `add_guard_ring`),
  tied to VSS (NMOS/PNP groups) or wrapping a VDD-tied n-well (PMOS
  groups). This keeps substrate noise injected near one matched group from
  coupling preferentially into a neighboring group's devices -- a supply
  bounce that reaches the amp's input pair asymmetrically (relative to its
  own mirror devices) would show up directly as VOS, the term Section 1
  identified as dominant.
- **One overall cell-level guard ring** (VSS tap + well tie) encloses the
  whole composed floorplan, isolating the analog cell from whatever
  digital or other circuitry sits next to it in a full-chip integration --
  standard practice for a noise-sensitive analog reference, and the
  layer this issue's DRC-clean skeleton actually draws and checks (see
  Section 3).
- **PMOS groups** (MP1/MP2, MP3/MP4, MPOUT/MPAMP) sit in their own n-wells,
  tied to VDD via each block's own guard ring -- `diff_pair`'s
  `flavor="pfet"` draws this well automatically.
- **Metal-trunk VDD/VSS routing and the trim-tap connectivity** (which
  code-select tap on the trim ladder feeds which net) were deferred by #15.
  Issue #62 draws both -- see Section 5a.

### 5a. What issue #62's routed flow actually draws

**Per-matched-group rings are back on.** Upstream
[klayout-tools#441](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/441)
added `ring_gap_side`/`ring_gap_um`, cutting one routing opening through a
ring band and reporting it as a `GAP_<side>` port the router may cross. This
retires the first increment's trade-off (below): every matched group in the
routed layout now carries its own guard/collector ring **and** is wired to
the rest of the circuit, closing the matching-quality regression that
increment recorded.

> Historical note (first increment, PR #64): `klt gen-compose`'s router
> rejected every route to a non-tap port on a ringed block, forcing a choice
> between a group's own ring or its connectivity -- filed as
> [klayout-tools#434](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/434)
> (now closed via #441, used above).

**Intra-block bussing is now drawn, on met1.** The router still exposes only
one routing-metal role (`li1`, the same layer every generator draws its
device pads on) --
[klayout-tools#433](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/433)'s
merged fix (#439) made a same-block bus attempt fail *visibly* rather than
silently short, but did not make it *drawable*, and the follow-up capability
request ([klayout-tools#454](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/454))
is still open. This flow therefore draws every intra-block bus itself with
`klt draw`, on met1 over mcon -- the sky130 extraction deck's own second
conductor and via, which `klt extract` already wires up generically. See
`layout/bin/met1_bus.py` and `gen_bandgap_routed.py`'s `MET1_BUS_NOTE`. This
is what turns the 108-unit ladder into two real series resistors and each
8-unit PNP array into one real `m=8` device, instead of N unconnected units.

**Inter-block nets are now drawn on met1 too**, for the same routing-metal
reason -- `gen-compose` only ever routed 2-pin nets between channel-adjacent
blocks; met1 does not care about crossing other blocks' interiors. Measured
against `design/bandgap_core.sch`'s own node list (not this flow's own
routing declaration), **8 of 12 schematic inter-block nets are fully drawn
across every block they reach** -- 4/12 in the first increment, 6/12 in the
second -- see the routed record's "Schematic inter-block nets" table for the
per-net breakdown.

> Historical note (second increment, PR #65): at that point **6 of 12**
> schematic inter-block nets were fully drawn and no MOS gate could be
> contacted at all, so every remaining gap terminated on a gate.

**MOS gates are contacted, and the matched pairs are bussed** (fourth
increment). Every `klt gen` MOS generator on sky130 draws gate poly with
**exactly** the active region's extent (poly and diff share both edges) and
reports the gate port on that shared boundary, so the generator leaves no
landing area a contact could legally sit on --
[klayout-tools#461](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/461),
still open. Rather than wait, this flow draws the missing piece itself, from
the generator's own reported gate port: a poly extension of the port's
reported width past the active edge, then a licon and an li1 pad on it. That
overhang is what every real foundry PDK draws for exactly this purpose, and
it is DRC-clean under the curated deck -- unlike the two illegal
alternatives the gap forces (a contact straddling the diff edge, or one
sitting on poly over the channel), neither of which this flow will draw to
make a number move.

With a contactable gate, `layout/bin/mos_bus.py` buses each `diff_pair`
block's `2 x splits` unit devices into the two devices the schematic
contains: one met1 **lane** per node inside each device row (a unit's li1
pad is the device's full width tall, so each node drops its vias at its own
lane's height and lanes never need to cross), nested riser/escape bundles
either side, and a guard-ring tie dropped where the ring's node already runs
over its west band. `klt lvs` now folds the layout to 37 devices against the
reference's 16, with 5 device and 1 net correspondences established -- from
97-vs-16 and none in the second increment.

**The gate band is the residual generator constraint.** `diff_pair`'s
guard-ring padding (0.5 um) and inter-row spacing (0.4 um) are module
constants with no parameter, and the band they leave holds exactly one gate
contact row per side. This circuit's five matched groups fit only because
the bus splits each block's gate nets three ways -- one net stubbed inboard
to the innermost lane, one routed outboard past the ring, and a
diode-connected device's gate bonded straight to its own pad on li1. A group
needing two independent non-diode gate nets has nowhere left to go. Filed as
[klayout-tools#484](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/484).

**What still isn't drawn, and why.** **8 of 12** schematic inter-block nets
are now fully drawn (`VB`, `VOUT`, `D2` and `VSS` are not). Every remaining
gap is a hop this repo's *own* met1 router could not place without a drawn
short -- a routing-quality limit of `gen_bandgap_routed.py`, not a node the
tool cannot express. That is a change of kind from the previous two
increments, whose gaps were all upstream capability gaps.

The routed record's "Schematic inter-block nets" table is the measured,
per-net version of this. Issue #62's criterion 1 is scored **PARTIAL** on it
-- the reference netlist is *not* adjusted to accommodate any of it (an
earlier revision bridged `AOUT`/`GDRV` with a 0-ohm device -- that stays
removed).

### 5b. Corrections and additions from the third increment (issue #62)

> The fourth increment (Section 5a's gate-contact bus) kept every correction
> below, and Section 5c records where its own measurements superseded the
> numbers quoted here.

The paragraph above was **not accurate**, and the third increment's first
job was to find out how much of "blocked on the gate gap" was really the
gate gap. Four things were not:

1. **`VSS` was never gate-blocked -- it was simply failing to route.** Its
   terminals are four NMOS sources and two PNP base ties; not one of them is
   a gate. The single unrouted hop (bottom-left PNP trunk to the top-right
   NMOS mirror) was losing its corridor to an earlier net, and the router
   had no way to express the path that exists: out of the block into a free
   vertical channel, across on a free horizontal band, and back in. Its
   four-segment escapes only offered lateral shifts of 1.2-3.6 um. The
   router now derives the floorplan's free channels and bands from the
   placed block extents and tries paths through them (`free_channels()` /
   `_channel_paths()`), and every declared net routes -- `unrouted: 0`,
   still with zero drawn-short conflicts and clean DRC. It is also ~8x
   faster, because the right path is now found immediately instead of after
   a long blind offset sweep.
2. **`GDRV` was never declared at all**, on the stated grounds that it is a
   gate node. Two of its four terminals are gates (MPOUT/MPAMP); the other
   two are MP4's and MN3's **drains**, ordinary li1 pads in two different
   blocks. That link is drawn from this increment on, so `GDRV` is a
   partially drawn node rather than a pair of disconnected labels. Its gate
   end stays open and stays disclosed.
3. **Bulk terminals were floating.** The reference puts every MOS bulk on a
   supply (`... VDD VDD pfet` / `... VSS VSS nfet`). Each `diff_pair`'s
   guard ring *is* that bulk tie and reports it as `TAP_*` on li1 -- nothing
   about the gate gap applies -- but nothing connected them, so every PMOS
   group's well extracted as an anonymous net. They are on the supply trunks
   now; the extracted PMOS bulk terminal reads `VDD` instead of `$186`.
   (The NMOS bulk still reads `vsubs`: sky130's deck ties every NMOS body to
   its global substrate net by `connect_global` rather than deriving it from
   drawn geometry. That is documented deck behaviour, and `klt lvs` reports
   it as a coverage warning of its own -- not something this layout can
   change by drawing more metal.)
4. **The layout was asserting `VOUT` and `TAIL` are one node.** A `pins[]`
   entry labels a *port*, i.e. a pad. The pin selector and the router kept
   separate "already used" sets, so `VOUT`'s label landed on
   `core_mirror.M2_1_D` -- MPAMP's drain, and the pad the drawn `TAIL` net
   contacts. The previous increment's extracted netlist therefore contains a
   net named `TAIL|VOUT`. DRC is clean and the drawn-short check passes,
   because the collision is between *labels*, through a pad, not between
   met1 rectangles. `klt extract` emits it with an empty `warnings[]` and
   `klt lvs` compares it without comment -- filed upstream as
   [klayout-tools#470](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/470),
   where the tool gap is the silence rather than the collision. The two
   selectors now share one claimed-pad set, and the flow gates on a
   scan of the extracted netlist for any `A|B` net name.

**Device halves are now bound, once.** A `diff_pair` reports two port
families (`M1_*`/`M2_*`) and which one is which schematic transistor is this
flow's choice, not the generator's. Nothing was making that choice: each net
took whichever pad sat nearest its own centroid. So `PN` and the `AOUT`
label both landed on amp_pmirr's `M2` -- MP3's drain and MP4's drain on one
physical transistor -- and amp_nload's `D1` route and `D1_GATE` label
disagreed about which half is MN1. `MOS_HALVES` in
`layout/bin/gen_bandgap_routed.py` binds every half to a named schematic
device, and every route resolves through it. Neither error was visible to DRC
or to the drawn-short check: every terminal involved is legal, well-separated
metal.

**Net effect on the acceptance criteria.** Criterion 1 stays **PARTIAL** at
6/12 fully drawn -- the six that remain short are genuinely short, and this
increment's honest gain is that the coverage table now credits partially
routed nodes for the blocks they *do* join (union-find over the routed hops,
largest connected component) instead of scoring an all-or-nothing net as
zero. Criterion 4 stays **NOT MET**: `mismatch_count` 365 -> 355, with
`devices.matched` still 0, because no split MOS group can collapse into the
`m=N` device the schematic states while every gate is unreachable. That
number will not move materially until klayout-tools#461 lands.

### 5c. Where the fourth increment's measurements supersede 5b's

Section 5b is the third increment's account and is left as written; three of
its numbers were measured on a floorplan with no MOS bussing in it and do not
survive the fourth increment's, which draws several times as much metal:

- **`unrouted: 0` (5b item 1) is no longer true** -- four declared nets
  (`VB`, `VOUT`, `D2`, `VSS`) lose a hop on the bussed floorplan. The
  channel router that closed `VSS` in the third increment is still here and
  is still what makes those nets *mostly* drawn; it is now tried after the
  short-detour ladder rather than before it, because a corridor across the
  whole cell is worth taking only when nothing cheaper works. Criterion 1 is
  scored on schematic-node coverage, which went **6/12 -> 8/12**.
- **The `TAIL|VOUT` collision (5b item 4) has a second instance.** Retiring
  the gate-port pin labels removed the mechanism that caused the first one,
  but this branch's own pre-merge record shipped `TRIM_A_CODE_MINUS16|VA`:
  a trim-tap label on a pad the drawn `VA` net already contacts. The
  claimed-pad set (`routed_ports()`) still filters the trim taps, and the
  netlist scan still gates the flow -- which is how it was found.
- **`MOS_HALVES` is no longer a per-net pad lookup.** With both halves' S/D/G
  bussed from the generator's own port names there is no per-net pad choice
  left to bind; the table now names the schematic device each port family is,
  and every block's bus spec is written in schematic device names and
  resolved through it (`resolve_bus_devices()`), which rejects an unbound
  device or a doubly-bound half outright.

## 6. Area budget

| Item | Area |
|---|---|
| Amp transistors (MP1/MP2 + MN1-MN4 + MP3/MP4), analytic | 10,880 um^2 (`design/error-amp-offset-budget.md` Section 4) |
| MCC compensation cap, analytic (single-ended, not a matched pair -- see Section 2) | 9,600 um^2 |
| Core PNP + resistor + mirror devices, analytic (drawn/emitter area only) | ~735 um^2 (MPOUT+MPAMP 64, Q1 3.7, Q2 92.5, R1 35, R2A+R2B 540) |
| **Analytic device total** | **~21,215 um^2** |
| **Skeleton composed floorplan bbox** (measured, #15 -- includes guard rings, dummies, spacing, and the reduced R2A/R2B count from Section 4) | **35,763 um^2** (`layout/bandgap-core/reports/20260803-192947-e7a30b4/record.md`) |
| **Routed composed floorplan bbox** (measured, #62 second increment -- includes intra-/inter-block met1 bussing, per-group **and** cell-level guard rings, and the **real 108-unit** R2A/R2B ladder) | **40,019 um^2** (`layout/bandgap-core/reports/LATEST/record.md`) |
| **Budget** | **50,000 um^2 (0.05 mm^2)** |

The skeleton's measured footprint (35,763 um^2) was within budget with ~29%
margin, but did **not** include the R2A/R2B ladder at its real 108-unit
count. Issue #62 closed that gap (Section 4a): the routed cell draws the
full 108-unit ladder *and* its inter-block routing and measures 40,019 um^2
-- ~20% inside the 50,000 um^2 budget (the second increment's restored
per-group guard rings and met1 busing cost ~1,848 um^2 versus the first
increment's ring-off, unbussed 38,171 um^2, still comfortably inside
budget). The budget claim now covers the real device counts, not a
reduced-scale stand-in.
`design/device-characterization-summary.md`'s own note on `MPOUT`/`MPAMP`
sizing (a potential 6.25x per-unit-area increase to size E) is a small
fraction of the remaining ~11,800 um^2 margin and is not expected to be a
blocker on its own. The largest un-budgeted item is now MCC, still carried
analytically (9,600 um^2) rather than drawn -- adding it would consume most
of the remaining margin, so it is the next real area question.

## 7. `klt` generator mapping and friction

Status as of issue #62's routed flow, third increment (the #15 column is
kept because the skeleton's own checked-in records were produced under it):

| Matched group | Generator | DRC-clean | Extraction status at #15 | Extraction status at #62 (current) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PNP arrays (Q1, Q2) | `bjt_array` | yes | no -- `klt extract` on a `bjt_array` output reports `device_count: 0` | **yes, 24 `pnp` devices** (dummies included), drawn by the generator itself since upstream [klayout-tools#440](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/440) (the first increment's local recognition overlay is retired) |
| Resistor ladders (R2A/R2B, R1, trim) | `res_array` | yes | no -- never drew the PDK's resistor-ID marker layer (2AMLogic/klayout-tools#369) | **yes, 159 `res_generic_po` devices** -- #369 merged upstream via klayout-tools#382. Only the base flavour is drawable -- [klayout-tools#463](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/463) |
| Amp input pair, NMOS loads/mirrors, PMOS mirror, core mirror | `diff_pair` | yes | not attempted | **yes, 52 `pfet` + 16 `nfet`** -- the nfet flavour needed klayout-tools#421 (guard-ring well tie enclosing nfet devices in nwell), merged via klayout-tools#426. The generator draws no contactable gate landing area -- [klayout-tools#461](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/461), worked around by this flow drawing the poly extension itself (Section 5a) |
| Overall guard ring | `guard_ring` (standalone) | yes | n/a | n/a -- composed in a **second** `gen-compose` pass, because a ring enclosing the whole floorplan reports a bbox that the router treats as an obstacle vetoing every net |
| Per-group guard rings | `add_guard_ring`/`add_collector_ring` (built into `diff_pair`/`bjt_array`) | yes | n/a | **on**, with a routing opening (klayout-tools#441) -- see Section 5a |
| Intra-block bussing (array units, ladder segments) | `met1_bus.py` (`klt draw`, this repo) | yes | n/a | **drawn on met1**, not through `gen-compose` -- see Section 5a and `MET1_BUS_NOTE` |
| Matched-pair bussing (MOS units into `m=N` devices) + gate contacts | `mos_bus.py` (`klt draw`, this repo) | yes | n/a | **drawn** -- one met1 lane per node per row, nested escapes, self-drawn gate poly extension. A workaround for [klayout-tools#461](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/461) and [#484](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/484), not a fix |
| 2D floorplan composition | `gen-compose` `placement.strategy: "explicit"` | n/a | n/a | placement only; `connectivity[]` is empty (routing is on met1) and `pins[]` carries the trim-ladder taps alone |

Friction filed or cross-confirmed while building this floorplan, per
`CLAUDE.md`'s protocol (tool-gap description only, no design-specific
detail beyond a generic reproduction):

- **New**: [2AMLogic/klayout-tools#415](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/415)
  -- `res_array` draws a single row with no fold/meander parameter, so a
  matched resistor ladder with 100+ unit segments cannot fit a compact
  floorplan (Section 4 above is the concrete case that surfaced this).
- **Already tracked, confirmed applicable here, not re-filed**:
  [2AMLogic/klayout-tools#176](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/176)
  (no bipolar-device LVS recognition -- closed as "draw geometry from base
  layers" was the accepted mechanism, which is exactly why `bjt_array`
  DRC-cleans but does not extract) and
  [2AMLogic/klayout-tools#369](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/369)
  (resistor-array output does not extract as a recognized resistor either).
- **Picked up, not filed** (a capability gap this issue needed that had
  already landed upstream by the time this issue was built):
  [2AMLogic/klayout-tools#330](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/330)
  added `gen-compose`'s `placement.strategy: "explicit"`, which is what
  makes the real 2D (not single-row) floorplan in Section 3 possible.
  `layout/requirements.txt`'s pin was bumped to pick this up -- see that
  file's own comment, and the refreshed
  `layout/trivial-cell/reports/` record confirming the bump does not
  regress issue #14's own DRC/LVS proof.

### 7a. Friction filed while routing the core (issue #62)

**First increment (PR #64), all three now CLOSED upstream:**

- **[klayout-tools#432](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/432)**
  (closed via #440) -- `gen bjt_array` now draws the bipolar
  device-recognition marker and well tap itself; the local recognition
  overlay PR #64 had to compose is retired.
- **[klayout-tools#433](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/433)**
  (closed via #439) -- the router now *rejects* a same-block bus attempt
  instead of certifying it as a routed short. It does not make bussing
  drawable -- see #454 below, and Section 5a for the met1 workaround this
  increment uses instead.
- **[klayout-tools#434](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/434)**
  (closed via #441) -- `ring_gap_side` lets the router cross into a
  guard-ringed block, so per-group rings and connectivity are no longer
  mutually exclusive (Section 5a).

**Second increment (PR #65), and where each stands after the fourth:**

- **[klayout-tools#454](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/454)**
  -- re-raises #433's un-shipped half: there is still no metal2/via role or
  via-drop routing, so `gen-compose` itself cannot draw an intra-block bus;
  this flow's `met1_bus.py` is a layout-side workaround, not a fix.
- **[klayout-tools#461](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/461)**
  -- MOS gate poly is drawn exactly coincident with the diffusion edge, so
  the generator leaves no landing area a contact can sit on. Still open
  upstream; the fourth increment stops waiting on it and draws the missing
  poly extension itself (Section 5a). That is a layout-side workaround, not
  a fix: the extension's size, direction and the room it has to fit in are
  decided here, per block, rather than by the generator that knows the
  device.
- **[klayout-tools#462](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/462)**
  -- the dummy-device marker-layer suppression path only covers MOS gates,
  never bipolar or resistor devices, so this layout's array dummy edge
  units extract as real, unmatched devices.
- **[klayout-tools#463](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/463)**
  -- `res_array` on sky130 can only draw the base `res_generic_po` flavour;
  a schematic built on a higher-sheet-rho flavour has no matching drawable
  device class.

**Third increment (PR #67), one new filing:**

- **[klayout-tools#470](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/470)**
  -- when two different net labels land on one electrical net, KLayout names
  it `A|B`, and `klt extract` emits that net with an empty `warnings[]`
  while `klt lvs` compares it without comment. The most dangerous error this
  toolchain can produce -- "the layout asserts two schematic nodes are one"
  -- is reported only as a punctuation mark inside a net name, invisible to
  DRC (the collision is between labels, through a pad, not between wires).
  Found because the second increment's own layout had shipped one; see
  Section 5b item 4. The flow scans the extracted netlist for it and gates on
  the result, but every caller having to reinvent a `"|" in name` check is
  the gap. Still earning its keep in the fourth increment: this branch had
  retired the pin-label table that caused the original collision and shipped
  a `TRIM_A_CODE_MINUS16|VA` net anyway, which the gate caught on merge.

**Fourth increment (this PR), filed while bussing the matched pairs:**

- **[klayout-tools#484](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools/issues/484)**
  -- `diff_pair`'s guard-ring padding, inter-row spacing and ring width are
  module constants with no parameter, and the band they leave between the
  outermost active edge and the ring holds exactly one gate contact row per
  side. Both matched devices' gate nets therefore cannot be brought out of a
  ringed block the same way; the inboard / outboard / li1-bond split
  `layout/bin/mos_bus.py` uses is a circuit-specific answer, not a general
  one. The other half of #461: #461 is "there is nowhere on the gate to put
  a contact", #484 is "there is nowhere beside it to put the wire that
  leaves it".

None of #461/#462/#463 moved upstream during the third or fourth increments,
so none of their consequences changed by themselves. What changed is how much
is attributed to them: the third increment (Section 5b) found four things
recorded as blocked by #461 that were not, and the fourth stops waiting on
#461 altogether and draws the missing gate landing area itself (Section 5a).

Two gaps the first increment **picked up rather than filed**, having landed
upstream in the interval: klayout-tools#415 (`res_array` row folding,
Section 4a) and klayout-tools#421 (`diff_pair`'s nfet-in-nwell
misclassification). Both are covered by `layout/requirements.txt`'s pin
bump; #421's fix was verified effective before relying on it (an isolated
`flavor: "nfet"` `diff_pair` now extracts `{"nfet": 8}`, not `pfet`).

## 8. Known limitations / follow-on work

- **LVS is not clean.** *(Still open; the reason has changed four times
  now.)* At #15 the blocker was device recognition -- neither `bjt_array`
  nor `res_array` output extracted as devices at all. The first increment
  (PR #64) closed that and hit the single-routing-metal bussing gap
  (klayout-tools#433). The second (PR #65) closed *that* with a layout-side
  met1 bus and hit the gate-contact gap (klayout-tools#461), leaving 365
  mismatches. The third (PR #67) bound the device halves, wired the bulk
  terminals and closed the `VSS` routing hole, taking it to 355 -- with
  `devices.matched` still 0, because nothing can fold while every gate is
  unreachable. This increment works around #461 by drawing the gate's missing
  poly landing area itself (Section 5a) and buses every matched pair, taking
  the count to **81**: `klt lvs` now folds 37 layout devices against the
  reference's 16 (from 97) and establishes 5 device and 1 net
  correspondences (from none). The remaining causes, in order of size:
  four inter-block nodes this repo's own met1 router still cannot draw
  (`VB`, `VOUT`, `D2`, `VSS` -- a routing-quality limit, not a tool gap);
  klayout-tools#462 (dummy edge units of the PNP/resistor arrays extract as
  real, unmatched devices); #463 (the layout can only draw
  `res_generic_po`, not the schematic's higher-sheet-rho flavour); and MCC,
  which is not drawn at all. The routed record's "LVS mismatch analysis"
  section quantifies and attributes each. Rewriting the reference netlist to
  enumerate the layout's own shortfalls would make LVS compare the layout
  against itself and is explicitly not done.
- ~~**R2A/R2B ladder is at reduced scale**~~ -- **closed** by issue #62, see
  Section 4a. The ladder is drawn at its real 108-unit count.
- ~~**Per-matched-group guard rings are off in the routed layout**~~ --
  **closed** by this increment, see Section 5a. klayout-tools#441 landed;
  every matched group now has its own ring **and** is wired.
- **The amp's 4-device NMOS load/mirror group (MN1-MN4) is split into two
  matched pairs** because `diff_pair` only common-centroids two devices at a
  time; a true 4-device common-centroid quad (the textbook ABBA/BAAB
  arrangement for a group this size) is not directly expressible with
  today's generators. Not filed as new friction -- flagged here for whoever
  picks up full tape-out-ready layout, since it may be resolvable by a
  different placement of two `diff_pair` instances relative to each other
  rather than needing a new generator.
- **Inter-block connectivity is now mostly drawn, but not complete** -- 8 of
  12 schematic inter-block nets are joined across every block they reach (4
  in the first increment, 6 in the second and third), via met1 (Section 5a).
  The four that are not (`VB`, `VOUT`, `D2`, `VSS`) each have one hop this
  repo's own router could not place without a drawn short. That is the first
  time the residual gap on this criterion is *ours* rather than upstream's,
  and it is the obvious next lever: a maze router over the placement
  channels, rather than `gen_bandgap_routed.py`'s current fixed repertoire of
  elbows, Z-detours and free-channel corridors, should close it without any
  new tool capability. Issue #62's criterion 1 is scored PARTIAL, not MET, on
  this.
- ~~**MOS finger bussing is not drawn**~~ -- **closed** by this increment,
  see Section 5a. Every matched pair's split units are bussed into the two
  devices the schematic contains, and every gate is contacted through a
  self-drawn poly extension. Intra-block bussing is now drawn for all three
  device families (PNP arrays, resistor ladders, matched MOS pairs).
- **Every guard/collector ring is now tied to its node** (`VDD` for the
  three PMOS groups, `VSS` for the two NMOS groups) rather than left
  floating, so a pfet group's bulk terminal is the supply the schematic says
  it is instead of an unmatched net.
- **Array dummy edge units extract as real devices** with no schematic
  counterpart (klayout-tools#462) -- turning them off to shrink the LVS
  mismatch count would trade a real matching property for a smaller number,
  so this flow keeps them and reports the count honestly.
- **The resistor flavour drawn (`res_generic_po`) does not match the
  schematic's higher-sheet-rho flavour** (klayout-tools#463) -- a
  device-class mismatch with no layout-side workaround.
- **MCC is still not drawn** (analytic allocation only, Section 6) -- now
  the largest single un-budgeted item.
- **The NMOS bulk terminal is compared against a synthesized net, not drawn
  geometry.** Both NMOS groups' substrate guard-ring taps are wired to `VSS`
  from the third increment on (Section 5b item 3), but sky130's extraction
  deck ties every NMOS body to its global `vsubs` net by `connect_global`
  rather than deriving it from the drawn tap, so the extracted nfet bulk
  reads `vsubs` where the reference says `VSS`. This is documented deck
  behaviour that `klt lvs` reports as a coverage warning of its own; no
  amount of drawn metal changes it, and the reference is not edited to say
  `vsubs`. The PMOS side *is* derived from drawn geometry (sky130's deck has
  a real tap layer), which is why wiring the PMOS well rings changed the
  extracted bulk from an anonymous net to `VDD`.
